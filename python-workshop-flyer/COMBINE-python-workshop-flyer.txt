Workshop Description

In this workshop, we provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals
of the Python programming language (python.org) and its data processing
features through worked-examples involving bioinformatics datasets.

Upon completion, you will have gained a foundational proficiency in
Python, enabling you to use some of its powerful (and
programmer-friendly) features in research-related tasks.

We are aiming to cover the following topics:

A review of programming fundamentals (e.g. variables, loops, conditions,
procedures, and data types), principles of good programming style,
introduction to bioinformatics libraries, and manipulating
bioinformatics datasets.

If you have a specific topic or problem in your research programming
that you would like covered, please email us at
workshops@combine.org.au.

About the Presenter

Dr. Bernie Pope is a specialist programmer at the VLSCI, a
high-performance computing (HPC) facility for life sciences research. He
is also an Honorary Fellow and lecturer for COMP10001 Foundations in
Computing in the Department of Computing and Information Systems at the
University of Melbourne.

His research interests include programming language implementation and
theory, especially functional programming languages such as Haskell.
Recently focussing on bioinformatics and computational biology, Dr Pope
teaches several of VLSCI's programming skills courses, helping
scientists unlock the potential of HPC facilities for their everyday
research.
