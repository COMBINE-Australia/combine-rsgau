### Workshop Description

In this workshop, we provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals
of Python and its data processing features through worked-examples
involving bioinformatics datasets.

Upon completion of the workshop, you will have gained a foundational
proficiency in Python, enabling you to use some of its powerful (and
programmer-friendly) features in research-related tasks.

The following topics will be covered:

A review of programming fundamentals (e.g. variables, loops,
conditions, procedures, and data types), principles of good programming
style, introduction to bioinformatics libraries, and manipulating
bioinformatics datasets.

If you have a specific topic or problem in your research programming
that you would like covered, please email us at TBD.

### What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language suitable for
programmers of all abilities due to its distinctly clear and readable
syntax. It is used in a wide variety disciplines and is supported by an
extensive range of open-source libraries.

One of its many strengths is its ability to perform ad-hoc analysis and
visualisation of large datasets common to the computational life
sciences; whether it be sequence, network, genomic, or structural data.

[python.org](http://www.python.org).

Dr. Bernie Pope is a specialist programmer at the VLSCI, a high-performance
computing (HPC) facility for life sciences research. He is also an Honorary
Fellow and occasional lecturer in the University of Melbourne's Department of
Computing and Information Systems.

His research interests include programming language implementation and theory,
especially functional programming languages such as Haskell. Focussing now on
bioinformatics and computational biology, Dr Pope teaches several of VLSCI's
programming skills courses, helping scientists unlock the potential of HPC
facilities for their everyday research.

### About Us

[COMBINE](http://www.combine.org.au) is the official [ISCB Regional Student
Group](http://www.iscbsc.org/content/regional-student-groups) for Australia, a
student-run organisation for researchers in computational biology,
bioinformatics, and related fields. 

We aim to bring together students and early career researchers from the
computational and life sciences for networking, collaboration and professional
development.

For more information about COMBINE, upcoming events, or to become a volunteer,
please visit our website at [combine.org.au](http://www.combine.org.au).

If you would like to present your research (completed or work-in-progress)
please email us at [combine@combine.org.au](mailto:combine@combine.org.au),
our seminars provide a forum for instant feedback and is an excellent
opportunity to perfect your presentation before those big conferences and
completion seminars!
