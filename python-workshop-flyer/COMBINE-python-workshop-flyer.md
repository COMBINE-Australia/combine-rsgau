### Workshop Description

In this workshop, we provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of
Python programming language ([python.org](http://www.python.org)) and its data
processing features through worked-examples involving bioinformatics datasets.

Upon completion of the workshop, you will have gained a foundational
proficiency in Python, enabling you to use some of its powerful (and
programmer-friendly) features in research-related tasks.

The following topics will be covered:

A review of programming fundamentals (e.g. variables, loops,
conditions, procedures, and data types), principles of good programming
style, introduction to bioinformatics libraries, and manipulating
bioinformatics datasets.

If you have a specific topic or problem in your research programming
that you would like covered, please email us at TBD.

Dr. Bernie Pope is a specialist programmer at the VLSCI, a high-performance
computing (HPC) facility for life sciences research. He is also an Honorary
Fellow and occasional lecturer in the University of Melbourne's Department of
Computing and Information Systems.

His research interests include programming language implementation and theory,
especially functional programming languages such as Haskell. Focussing now on
bioinformatics and computational biology, Dr Pope teaches several of VLSCI's
programming skills courses, helping scientists unlock the potential of HPC
facilities for their everyday research.
