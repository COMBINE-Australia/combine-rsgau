### Workshop Description

In this workshop, we provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of
the Python programming language ([python.org](http://www.python.org)) and its
data processing features through worked-examples involving bioinformatics
datasets.

Upon completion of the workshop, you will have gained a foundational
proficiency in Python, enabling you to use some of its powerful (and
programmer-friendly) features in research-related tasks.

We are aiming to cover the following topics:

A review of programming fundamentals (e.g. variables, loops,
conditions, procedures, and data types), principles of good programming
style, introduction to bioinformatics libraries, and manipulating
bioinformatics datasets.

If you have a specific topic or problem in your research programming
that you would like covered, please email us at
[workshops@combine.org.au](mailto:workshops@combine.org.au).

Dr. Bernie Pope is a specialist programmer at the VLSCI, a high-performance
computing (HPC) facility for life sciences research. He is also an Honorary
Fellow and lecturer for _[COMP10001 Foundations in
Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2013/COMP10001)_ in the
Department of Computing and Information Systems at the University of
Melbourne.

His research interests include programming language implementation and theory,
especially functional programming languages such as Haskell. Recently
focussing on bioinformatics and computational biology, Dr Pope teaches several
of VLSCI's programming skills courses, helping scientists unlock the potential
of HPC facilities for their everyday research.
